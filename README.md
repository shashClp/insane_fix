This is a fix/enhancement of the demo [Insane / Anaconda](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=282). I really like this demo, but on newer computers it sometimes crashed, looked slightly off and didn't allow to be displayed in the original ratio.

Most of the code changes are now over 10 years old, and have only been tested with Visual Studio 2008. As part of the process of fixing/enhancing this demo, I created a [video capture that I uploaded to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj-NCiclBgQ), for future enjoyment

Known port issues:
- The timing system is quite awful
- Uses TinyPTC for display, which runs on DDraw, which doesn't seem to handle DPI that well

If one day I am annoyed enough by them, might fix them, but for now it is time to move on :)
